I am a detailed-oriented, enthusiastic, and committed person offering optimized talents with comprehensive technical skills. I have the ability to draw impactful results to influence business decision-making.

My goal is to develop myself and learn as much as I can. I love learning and solve problems. I have been driven by exploring and analyzing data. "Knowledge is power and with power comes respect."

Outside of work and education, I love to watch basketball and am a fan of the Spurs team. The team's passion really inspires me. Also, I like to travel to many countries to learn about different cultures and meet new people. 

I am interested in a wide variety of fields including but not limited to data management, data science, database administration, and database analyst. I  am interested in turning data into stories through visualization and analysis. I have experience working with Apache Spark scikit-learn, Tensorflow, pandas, and many other popular data analysis and machine learning libraries.


Key skills – Python,  SQL(Oracle, MySQL, MS SQL), R, Statistics, MS Excel, Tableau
